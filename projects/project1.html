        <h1>My first IT project : </h1>
        <h2>Car service</h2>
        <p>My first project was the web application. The project contained : the database with 3 joined tables,communication of application with database(realized through the PDO library),completed through OOP. Theme was a car service web application, which was used to book the term car service to users who registered their profile on the application . The project was successfully defended. Since this is the first version of the application, I have many more ideas to implement.</p>
