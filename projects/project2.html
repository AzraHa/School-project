      <h1>My second IT project : </h1>
      <h2>Laravel blog</h2>
      <p>Project I was worked on was a blog.I edit the project as a food blog. The project contains controllers (public and private), models and migration,the auth and admin middleware that I made.I used bootstrap example templates for design.For now users can create,read,edit and delete their posts, and they have to been signed in to edit ordelete them .Blog have comment section , but users also need to be signed in to comment any post .Admin can see all users,posts, comments, categories,...Admin can edit or delete them or add new post category.As this is the first version of this blog in the future I have planned to upgrade it and improve </p>
